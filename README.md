Activity Timer for Android TV will be a free, open source app that can count and beep. It helps with repeating tasks, such as meditation or exercise.

In essence, Activity Timer for Android TV is a version of Foto Timer, that runs on your big screen Android TV.

Activity Timer is working with "processes", which define how Activity Timer counts, and how often it beeps. Processes can also be "chained" together, meaning that a process can automatically lauch another.
